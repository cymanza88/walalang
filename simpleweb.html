        Bachelor of Science in Information Technology and then my major is Web and 
        Game Development.I want to be an Front-End Developer someday.Why I choose BSIT?

        i am and i want to learn some technology and prog languages and expand my knowledges.I
        learn some  knowledges in html, css, c++, java, mysql,networking and on my journey in college life
        i also enjoy the human computer interaction like interfaces and design our application(sketching,wireframe,prototypes etc).
